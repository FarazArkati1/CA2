This program offers all the requested information about the desired movie, including a synopsis, the genre, the release date, the rating, the length, the top cast, reviews, suggested viewings, etc.

The movie information (title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc.) is retrieved using an API by TMDB, available at https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api. Using the IMDB id of the film in the API, I performed web scraping to obtain the user reviews submitted to the IMDB site using the user ID "beautifulsoup4". I then conducted sentiment analysis on those reviews.

## How to get the API key?

Create an account at https://www.themoviedb.org, select the 'API' link from the left sidebar in your account settings, then fill out all the necessary information to request an API key. If prompted for the website URL, simply respond "NA" if you don't know it. When your request is accepted, the API key will appear on your "API" sidebar.

1. Create a local copy of this repository.
2. Use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install every library listed in the [requirements.txt] file.
